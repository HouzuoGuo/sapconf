The utility adjusts operating system parameters, such as kernel tuning settings and resource limits, to allow running various SAP solutions at satisfactory performance.

The utility is deprecated in favour of [saptune](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/saptune) with the SP2 release of SLES4SAP 12. However, it continues to be fully supported on SLES and SLES4SAP.
