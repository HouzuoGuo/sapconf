# /usr/sbin/sapconf traditionally performed automatic system tuning for SAP
# Netweaver products.
# During the course of SLES 12 SP1 development, the system tuning
# implementation is moved entirely into tune daemon profiles.
# In additional to support SAP Netweaver tuning, sapconf is extended to be
# also able to activate HANA tuning profile via the tune daemon.
